 * 
 * The @EnableAsync annotation switches on Springâ€™s ability to run @Async
 * methods in a background thread pool. This class also customizes the used
 * Executor by defining a new bean. Here the method is named taskExecutor since
 * this is the specific method name Spring will search for. In our case, we want
 * to limit the number of concurrent threads to 2 and limit the size of the
 * queue to 500. There are many more things you can tune. If the user does not
 * define an Executor bean Spring will create a SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor and use
 * that.
